# Car-Inventory-Subsystem
MySQL Database storing Inventory of a car lot using Java and JDBC

To utilize this code, you need to have a Database already created within your system that this code can link to, we did not implement a cloud sql database.
This code runs through the console and it imitates a program that can be used at a dealership to search, add, delete or update records of the cars that are found on the lot.
